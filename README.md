# The LinkedIn Developer Productivity & Happiness Framework (DPH Framework)

At LinkedIn, we have a fairly advanced system for understanding our developers,
the success of our engineering work, and where we should focus our
infrastructure efforts to be most effective.

This repository contains the documents that describe this system. They are
mostly direct copies of the internal documents that our own engineers read to
understand how this works.

This document set explains how to define metrics and feedback systems for
software developers, how to get action taken on that data, and provides examples
of a few internal metrics that we use.

You can read the documents in any order. Each one is designed to be able to be
read and referenced independently. However, we provide a suggested sequence and
hierarchy here:
